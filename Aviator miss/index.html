The player places a bet and then releases a ball from the top of the board, which bounces off the pegs and eventually lands in one of these slots. Depending on the slot in which the ball landed, the player's bet amount is multiplied by a coefficient, which ultimately determines whether the bet has been played or not. Thus, the player either wins money or loses, or stays on their own.
            The outcome of each game is determined by an RNG to ensure fairness."

      <h3>Plinko BGAMING</h3>
      <p>The popular gaming software developer and crypto gambling pioneer BGAMING presents its version of the Plinko game. </p>
      <p>On the right side of the screen, there is a pyramid-shaped field with lines of pegs, the number of which can be configured from 8 to 16. At the bottom of the pyramid, there are slots with different coefficients. When the ball hits such a slot, depending on its face value, the player either: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wins if the coefficient <strong>x > 1;</strong></li>
        <li>Loses if <strong>x < 1;</strong></li>
        <li>Remains at their own if <strong>x = 1.</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Under the playing field is the game control panel. In the center, there is a large «Play» button, with which the game starts and the ball falls from the top of the pyramid to its bottom, landing in one or another slot.</p>
      <p>To the left of the button, there are switches for risk levels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Low</strong> – it is the safest level of the game. There is only one slot that cuts your bet in half, and it is right in the middle of the slot line. There are also two «1» here, leaving you with your own, and the maximum win here is x16.</p>
            <p>This level is perhaps the most win-win, although the most boring. Here you will not earn large sums, but you will gradually move towards winnings. This level is suitable for beginners or cautious players who are used to not asking for trouble.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Normal</strong> – at this level, there are already 3 losing slots and the maximum win is x110 bet.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>High</strong> – here you will need your entire reserve of luck because at this level there are as many as five losing slots out of 11. However, the maximum win in the case of 16 lines of pegs is bet x1,000, which, if the maximum bet is $100, will bring you a $99,900 net profit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>To the right of the «Play» button, there is a switch for manual or auto betting control. Under the button, you will find the bet functional. You can choose the bet rate from $1 to $100.</p>
      <p>On the left side of the screen, there is a table of game activity, which shows the period of the game round, the size of the bet, the coefficient of the slot on which the ball landed, and the amount of the win:</p>
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Time</td>
                <td>Bet, $</td>

                <td>-70.00</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The table shows how in 4 minutes with a maximum bet of $100 at a High-risk level, $150 of a net profit was won.</p>
      <h3>Plinko Spribe</h3>
      <p>The principle of operation of Plinko from the manufacturer Spribe OU is identical to the game from BGAMING. The control panel has some differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are only three variants of lines with pegs: 12, 14, and 16;</li>
        <li>Risk levels are divided by colors: green - minimum, yellow - medium, and red – high. The maximum win in the case of 16 lines of pegs is bet x35 for the Minimum Level, x118 for Medium, and x555 for High;</li>
        <li>The minimum bet is 10 cents and the maximum is $100. You can choose the appropriate amount from the dropdown menu or type it in manually.</li>
        <li>Spribe's Plinko game gives the opportunity to get a «Free Bets» promo to attract and retain players. This promo allows players to place bets without risking their own money, providing a chance to win real money.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, Plinko by Spribe is based on «Provably Fair» technology to ensure fair gameplay for all players. This technology guarantees the transparency and randomness of game outcomes, increasing players' trust.</p>
      <h3>Plinko Turbo Games</h3>
      <p>An option from a young but promising provider «Turbo Games» - Plinko 3D. The principle remains the same, but the gameplay is animated by the number of balls - instead of the usual one ball falling from the top of the pyramid, you are offered 5 to 10 balls to choose from. This makes the game much more dynamic, increasing the possibility of winning. </p>
      <p>As well as in the two previous versions of Plinko, there are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>From 8 to 16 lines with pegs;</li>
        <li>3 levels of risk: LOW (the maximum win in the case of 16 lines of pegs is bet x22), MEDIUM (x120), and HIGH (x1,000);</li>
        <li>The minimum bet is 10 cents and the maximum one is $10. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, in the «Settings» section you can set your Nickname, limits on the amount of minimum/maximum bets and maximum winnings, as well as view statistics on your recent bets.</p>

        <h3>How to play Plinko?</h3>
        <p>To play the Plinko game at an online casino, players must choose their bet amount and then drop a virtual ball onto the board. The ball will bounce around the board before landing in a slot at the bottom, potentially awarding the player with a cash prize based on the slot they landed in.</p>
        <h3>Where to play Plinko?</h3>
        <p>Players can enjoy Plinko at Australian online casinos that offer the game in their libraries. It's important to choose a reliable and reputable online gaming portal to ensure a safe and fair gaming experience. </p>
        <p>If a player wants to get acquainted with the game or practice applying the strategy before moving on to real bets, they can choose a demo mode on the website of the official provider, such as Spribe OU, TurboGames, or BGAMING.</p>
        <h3>How does Plinko work?</h3>
        <p>The Plinko online casino game generally involves a game board with a grid of pegs and a series of slots at the bottom. The player places a bet and then releases a ball from the top of the board, which bounces off the pegs and eventually lands in one of these slots. Depending on the slot in which the ball landed, the player's bet amount is multiplied by a coefficient, which ultimately determines whether the bet has been played or not. Thus, the player either wins money or loses, or stays on their own.</p>
        <p>The outcome of each game is determined by an RNG to ensure fairness.</p>
        <h3>How to download Plinko?</h3>

        <h3>How many bets at the same time can I make in Plinko?</h3>
        <p>Usually, you can make one bet during the same round of the Plinko game. However, some variants of the game allow you to launch several balls at once, which is essentially several simultaneous bets.</p>
